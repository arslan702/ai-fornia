                    Like most website operators, AiFornia collects non-personally-identifying information of the
                    sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
                    language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. AiFornia's
                    purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
                    AiFornia's visitors use its website. From time to time, AiFornia may release non-personallyidentifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
                    its website.
                    AiFornia also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                    addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://AiFornia.com blog
                    posts. AiFornia only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                    circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
